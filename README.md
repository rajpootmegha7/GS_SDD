## Project Summary

Here at Garden Shepherd, we pride ourselves in our ability to help anyone with their forays into gardening. Whether itâ€™s your first time or your fiftieth, our app will provide you with the tools you need to create a garden and maintain it for years!

In the GardenShepard, the user is able to create a personalized account in order to search for various plants to plan their next gardening venture. Use the filters provided to narrow down the search and add them to your collection. Using the planner feature, the user will be able to accurately plan out the plants they wish to cultivate for the next growing season. Lastly, navigate to the About Us page to learn more about the developers.
